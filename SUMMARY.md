**ALET: Automated Labeling of Equipment and Tools Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and identification tasks. It is used in the robotics and safety industries. 

The dataset consists of 2644 images with 22068 labeled objects belonging to 49 different classes including *safety helmet*, *gloves*, *safety glass*, and other: *hammer*, *chisel*, *pliers*, *wrench*, *screwdriver*, *drill*, *mallet*, *saw*, *meter*, *pen*, *tape*, *safety headphones*, *spade*, *scissors*, *clamp*, *pencil*, *safety mask*, *trowel*, *bench vise*, *plane*, *aviation snip*, *grinder*, *ruler*, *file*, *brush*, *stapler*, *level*, *marker*, *ratchet*, *knife*, *square*, *rake*, *caulk gun*, *hex key*, *putty knife*, *tape dispenser*, *axe*, *staple gun*, *hole punch*, *crowbar*, *soldering iron*, *caliper*, *anvil*, *flashlight*, *riveter*, and *pencil sharpener*.

Images in the ALET dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 34 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (2112 images), *val* (268 images), and *test* (264 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the Middle East Technical University, Turkey.
